- âœ… Full transcript download functionality with proper file management
- âœ… Production-ready solution with comprehensive error handling

#### Technical Impact
- **Before**: Buttons showed error messages, no working functionality
- **After**: Complete working advice and transcript features without external dependencies
- **User Experience**: Restored to 100% functionality in production environment
- **Architecture**: Demonstrated effective fallback design patterns

### âœ… Process Management System Completed (January 16, 2025)
- **Status**: COMPLETED and ARCHIVED  
- **Duration**: 2 hours (50% faster than 4-6 hour estimate)
- **Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- **Problem Resolved**: TelegramConflictError and polling conflicts eliminated
- **Archive**: [`memory-bank/archive/archive-process-management-system_20250116.md`](archive/archive-process-management-system_20250116.md)

#### Key Achievements
- âœ… Created `process_manager.py` (460 lines) - Comprehensive process management system
- âœ… Integrated single-instance enforcement in `main.py` startup sequence
- âœ… Automated duplicate process detection and graceful cleanup (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility via psutil (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- âœ… File-based locking with proper resource management
- âœ… Signal handling for graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT)

#### Production Testing Results
- âœ… Successfully detected and terminated 2 duplicate main.py processes
- âœ… Single-instance enforcement validated: lock acquisition/release working
- âœ… Process cleanup tested: 100% success rate (2/2 processes terminated)
