📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Rate Limiting Strategy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Implement fair usage rate limiting to prevent abuse and manage OpenAI API costs
   Requirements: Per-user limits, burst handling, admin overrides, transparent feedback
   Constraints: Redis storage, sub-second response time, graceful degradation

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Token bucket per user - Classic algorithm with refill rate
   Option B: Sliding window counter - Track requests in time windows
   Option C: Fixed window counter - Simple reset-based counting
   Option D: Distributed rate limiting - Cross-instance coordination

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Token Bucket | Sliding Window | Fixed Window | Distributed |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Fairness | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Memory Usage | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Burst Handling | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Token bucket allows natural burst handling but complex state management
   - Sliding window most accurate but memory intensive for large user base
   - Fixed window simple but allows burst at window boundaries
   - Distributed approach needed for multi-instance but adds complexity

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option A: Token Bucket with Redis Backend
   Rationale: Best balance of fairness and burst handling, Redis handles persistence
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Default limits: 10 requests/hour, burst of 3
   - Admin mode: unlimited (environment flag)
   - User feedback: clear messages with reset time
   - Graceful degradation: read-only mode during overload

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Cache Invalidation Strategy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Optimize cache performance while ensuring data freshness and memory efficiency
   Requirements: Handle 24h TTL, intelligent cleanup, LRU for memory pressure
   Constraints: Redis 256MB limit, background cleanup, no cache storms

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Pure TTL expiration - Redis native expiration only
   Option B: LRU + TTL hybrid - Combined memory and time-based eviction
   Option C: Write-through cache - Immediate updates with background refresh
   Option D: Cache warming - Predictive preloading based on patterns

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Pure TTL | LRU+TTL | Write-through | Cache Warming |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Memory Efficiency | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
   | Consistency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Pure TTL simple but may waste memory on unused entries
   - LRU+TTL optimal for memory management but needs tuning
   - Write-through ensures consistency but complex invalidation logic
   - Cache warming improves performance but requires usage analytics

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option B: LRU + TTL Hybrid with Smart Cleanup
   Rationale: Best memory utilization with performance benefits, manageable complexity
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Redis maxmemory-policy: allkeys-lru
   - TTL: 24h for transcripts, 1h for LLM responses
   - Background cleanup: hourly scan for expired entries
   - Memory pressure handling: aggressive cleanup at 80% usage

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Plugin System Architecture
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Design extensible mode registry allowing custom LLM configurations
   Requirements: Hot-reload capability, validation system, isolation, rollback mechanism
   Constraints: Python runtime, JSON config, backward compatibility, security isolation

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: File-based plugins - JSON configs with Python validation
   Option B: Database-driven registry - PostgreSQL with versioning
   Option C: API-based plugins - REST endpoints for external integrations
   Option D: Hybrid approach - File configs with database persistence

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | File-based | Database | API-based | Hybrid |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Simplicity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Hot-reload | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Versioning | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Security | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - File-based approach simplest for MVP but limited scalability
   - Database adds complexity but better for multi-instance deployments
   - API-based allows external integrations but security concerns
   - Hybrid approach combines benefits but increases complexity

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option A: File-based with JSON Schema Validation
   Rationale: MVP-appropriate, easy to implement and debug, sufficient for single-instance deployment
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Config directory: /app/modes/ with JSON files
   - JSON schema validation for all mode definitions
   - File watcher for hot-reload capability
   - Rollback: backup configs before changes
   - Sandboxed validation: test mode before activation

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Error Recovery Workflow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Design comprehensive error handling for multi-stage pipeline failures
   Requirements: Stage isolation, partial recovery, user feedback, system health monitoring
   Constraints: 5s total timeout, graceful degradation, no data loss, clear error reporting

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Fail-fast approach - Stop on first error with immediate feedback
   Option B: Best-effort processing - Continue with available results
   Option C: Retry with fallbacks - Multiple attempts with degraded modes
   Option D: Circuit breaker pattern - System-level protection with recovery

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Fail-fast | Best-effort | Retry+Fallback | Circuit Breaker |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | User Experience | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | System Protection | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Data Integrity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Fail-fast simple but poor user experience for transient failures
   - Best-effort provides value even with partial failures
   - Retry with fallbacks maximizes success rate but adds complexity
   - Circuit breaker protects system but may deny valid requests

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option C: Retry with Fallbacks + Partial Success
   Rationale: Maximizes user value while protecting system, acceptable complexity
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Stage isolation: each pipeline stage independent
   - Fallback chain: o3 → gpt-4o → gpt-3.5-turbo → template
   - Partial success: return available results with missing section notes
   - Error classification: temporary, permanent, rate-limit
   - Health monitoring: track failure rates per stage

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Multi-Container Orchestration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Optimize Docker architecture for development and production deployment
   Requirements: Service isolation, health monitoring, data persistence, easy scaling
   Constraints: Single-host deployment initially, resource limits, log aggregation

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Monolithic container - Single container with all services
   Option B: Microservices split - Separate containers per major component
   Option C: Service groups - Logical grouping of related services
   Option D: Sidecar pattern - Main app + auxiliary services

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Monolithic | Microservices | Service Groups | Sidecar |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Development Ease | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Scalability | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Resource Usage | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Fault Isolation | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Monolithic easier for development but poor isolation
   - Microservices provide best isolation but complex networking
   - Service groups balance simplicity with some isolation benefits
   - Sidecar good for auxiliary services but limited main app scaling

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option C: Service Groups (App + Redis + Worker)
   Rationale: Good balance for MVP with room for future microservices migration
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - App container: bot + API + whisper processing
   - Redis container: cache + session storage
   - Worker container: background cleanup + monitoring
   - Shared volumes: temporary file storage
   - Health checks: HTTP endpoints for each service
   - Log aggregation: centralized logging driver
