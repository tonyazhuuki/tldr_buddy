📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Text Processing Pipeline
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Optimize text chunking for long audio transcripts to maximize LLM processing efficiency
   Requirements: Handle 60s+ audio (10k+ chars), maintain context, minimize tokens, preserve meaning
   Constraints: OpenAI token limits (4k-128k), processing latency ≤5s, Russian/English languages

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Fixed-size chunking - Split by character count with overlap
   Option B: Semantic chunking - Split by sentences/paragraphs with NLP
   Option C: Sliding window - Overlapping chunks with context preservation
   Option D: Hierarchical chunking - Multi-level processing with summarization

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Fixed | Semantic | Sliding | Hierarchical |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Context Quality | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Implementation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
   | Memory Usage | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Fixed chunking loses context at arbitrary boundaries
   - Semantic chunking requires NLP libraries (complex, slower)
   - Sliding window maintains context but increases processing overhead
   - Hierarchical approach best for quality but complex implementation

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option C: Sliding Window with Smart Boundaries
   Rationale: Best balance of context preservation and performance, implementable within latency constraints
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Chunk size: 3000 chars with 500 char overlap
   - Smart boundary detection: sentence/paragraph endings
   - Fallback to word boundaries if no sentence breaks found
   - Cache boundary positions for efficiency

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Language Detection Algorithm
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Efficiently detect Russian/English text for targeted processing
   Requirements: Fast detection (<100ms), high accuracy (>95%), works with short texts (50+ chars)
   Constraints: No external APIs, minimal dependencies, works offline

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Character frequency analysis - Statistical approach using Cyrillic/Latin ratios
   Option B: Word dictionary matching - Compare against common word lists
   Option C: N-gram analysis - Character sequence probability models
   Option D: ML-based detection - Pre-trained lightweight models

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Frequency | Dictionary | N-gram | ML Model |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Accuracy | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Memory | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
   | Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Frequency analysis very fast but lower accuracy with mixed text
   - Dictionary matching good for pure language text but struggles with names/technical terms
   - N-gram analysis excellent accuracy with reasonable performance
   - ML models overkill for binary ru/en detection

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option A: Character Frequency with Fallback
   Rationale: Simplest implementation meeting speed requirements, with n-gram fallback for edge cases
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Primary: Cyrillic char ratio threshold (>30% = Russian)
   - Fallback: Common word detection if char ratio inconclusive (20-30%)
   - Cache results for repeated text patterns
   - Default to English for ambiguous cases

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Response Formatting Engine
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Create consistent, readable output format from multi-LLM results
   Requirements: Combine DEFAULT+TONE outputs, apply emoji icons, handle missing sections
   Constraints: Telegram message limits (4096 chars), maintain readability, error resilience

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Template-based formatting - Fixed structure with variable substitution
   Option B: Rule-based formatting - Dynamic structure based on content analysis
   Option C: Hybrid formatting - Template base with rule-based adaptations

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Template | Rule-based | Hybrid |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Consistency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Flexibility | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Maintainability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Templates ensure consistent format but may waste space
   - Rule-based approach adapts to content but unpredictable output
   - Hybrid offers best of both with manageable complexity

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option A: Template-based with Smart Truncation
   Rationale: Consistency crucial for user experience, truncation handles edge cases
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Fixed template: 📝 Summary • Bullets 👉 Actions 🎭 Tone
   - Smart truncation: bullets > summary > actions > tone (priority order)
   - Fallback messages for missing sections
   - Character limit monitoring with graceful degradation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 CREATIVE PHASE END

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Intelligent Retry Logic
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Handle OpenAI API failures gracefully with optimal retry strategy
   Requirements: Minimize user wait time, respect rate limits, differentiate error types
   Constraints: Total timeout ≤10s, avoid thundering herd, preserve request context

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Exponential backoff - Standard 2^n delay progression
   Option B: Linear backoff with jitter - Fixed intervals with randomization
   Option C: Adaptive backoff - Adjust based on error type and API response
   Option D: Circuit breaker pattern - Stop retrying after threshold failures

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Exponential | Linear+Jitter | Adaptive | Circuit Breaker |
   |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Efficiency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Rate Limit Respect | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Implementation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | User Experience | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Exponential backoff standard but may be too aggressive
   - Linear with jitter better for rate limiting scenarios
   - Adaptive approach best but complex to implement correctly
   - Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures but may be overkill

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option B: Linear Backoff with Jitter + Error Classification
   Rationale: Good balance of implementation simplicity and rate limit compliance
   
5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Base delay: 1s, increment: 1s, max: 5s
   - Jitter: ±30% randomization to prevent thundering herd
   - Error classification: rate limit (longer delay), temporary (normal), permanent (no retry)
   - Max 3 retries total, fail fast on auth errors
